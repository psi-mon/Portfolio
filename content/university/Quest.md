The Quest is a 3D space drum shooter where you fly with your drum set through space, destroy obstacles and collect as many points as possible. The game was developed for *Sony's Playstation Portable* with the *PhyreEngine* as part of the Master Course of Professional Practice in Dundee, Scotland.

The player can hit a single drum to fire a projectile with a specific color which can destroy obstacles of that color. Each drum is mapped to a different key and emits a projectile with a different color. By hitting the drums in a specific sequence, combos can be activated which fire random projectiles at a very fast interval. 

Since I was the only programmer in the team my responsibility was the complete code base. The challenge was to work with a complete new engine in a short period of time. In addition the documentation of the engine was very limited and in most cases written in Chinese which did not help at all.
