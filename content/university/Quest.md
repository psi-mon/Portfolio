The Quest is a 3D space drum shooter where you fly with your drum set through space, destroy obstacles and collect as many points as possible. The game was developed for Sony's Playstation Portable with the PhyreEngine as part of the Master Course of Professional Practice in Dundee, Scotland.

The Quest is a 3D space drum shooter where you fly with your drum set through space, destroy obstacles and collect as many points as possible. By hitting a single drum you can fire a projectile with a specific color which can destroy obstacles of that color. Each drum is mapped to a different key and emits a projectile with a different color. By hitting the drums in a specific sequence, combos can be activated fires random projectiles at a very fast interval. 

Since I was the only programmer in the team I was responsible for the complete code base. The challenge was to develop the game with Sony's PhyreEngine which was not free at that time. Therefore the documentation was restricted and rare (and in most cases in Chinese).
