Gunbus is a two player Action Game where you have to fight your way through the levels using different tanks. The game can be played as single player or with another player in coop mode. 

My responsibility was the implementation of the enemies AI where I used _A* path-finding_ for the navigation through the level. There are several different types of enemy which have different behaviors and attributes.
I implemented a _Hierarchical Finite State Machine_ with a _Message System_ which allowed us to design different behaviors for each enemy type with ease.

As part of the Master course the goal of this project was to release and present the game at the *dare to be digital* exhibition.
The challenge was to compensate changing requirements during the development process by the tutors as well as working in a bigger team with a tight schedule and a given deadline.
