In the game the player can test its knowledge about horses in different quizzes, pet and clean horses as well as take them out on a ride.

One of my responsibility was the implementation of the dynamic generated track system where the players can ride their horses. There are a huge number of parameters the game designer can define for each track and for small segments of a track ranging from the type of obstacle to the sprite of a background. Each parameter contains a probability which is used at runtime to determine which sprite or obstacle is being chosen. This ensures a good variation of the tracks when the same track is played multiple times but also guarantees a defined style and difficulty.
