MyWallstreet is a cross platform live trading App where you can trade *CFD products*. The application supports __Android, IOS and WebGL__. In addition a Trading Machine was designed were you can log in with a special trading card
to trade under your account. The Trading Machine runs a Linux derivative.

My main responsibility was the code maintainability and the implementation of the client back-end which communicates with the banking gateway. In addition I was in charge of designing, building and maintaining the trading machine.

The Challenge was to maintain a code base which supports four different platforms. In addition those platforms have different feature sets, different layouts or hardware restrictions. For the trading machine it was necessary to implement a card reader which was not needed on other platforms for examples. There were a variety of those exceptions which made it challenging to maintain a clean code.
