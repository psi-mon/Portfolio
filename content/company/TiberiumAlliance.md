*Command and Conquer - Tiberium Alliances* is a military science fiction massively multiplayer online real-time strategy video game which was original developed for the browser.

As part of a small team we joined __EA Phenomic__ in 2011 to port Command and Conquer - Tiberium Alliacnc to the IOS platform for iPhone and iPad.
The challenge was to keep up with the main development of the game by having huge constraints regarding limited resolution as well as the *none native* implementation for IOS.
