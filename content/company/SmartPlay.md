A hybrid game system which combines the classic board game with computer vision and Smartphones. There were two games developed using this approach - King Arthung and Das Magische Museum. 

The Smartphone is mounted on a stand and tracks the complete board with the help of a computer vision middle ware.
Therefore the App can verbally interact with the players - supporting the players or just add sound effects and short stories to enhance the immersion of the game.
