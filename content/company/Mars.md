Mars is an interactive novel supported through the DCF of the MFG Medien- und Filmgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg.


The novel contains ilustrations, sound effects, music, animations and minigames which support the immerse experience of the reader. In addition parallax images are used to add a 3D effect to the game. The player can move and tilt the iPad to "view different parts of a parallax image. At some points in the story the reader has to make a choice which effects the outcome of the story.

During the development process I was mentoring a Bachelor thesis which covered the implementation of a Story Tool for the game. With the help of this Story Tool it was possible to layout the text and add images, sounds and placeholders beforehand. This content was then loaded at runtime in the game which encapsulated the implementation from the actual content.
