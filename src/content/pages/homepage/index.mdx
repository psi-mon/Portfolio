Hi, I'm Simon Plutz, a Senior Software Engineer based in Munich, Germany. I'm passionate about game development, interactive systems, and creating engaging user experiences that bring ideas to life.

For over 8 years, I've been developing software solutions across multiple platforms, specializing in Unity3D game development, web applications, and mobile apps. My journey started with a fascination for how technology can create immersive experiences and has evolved into a career building everything from educational games for children to complex business applications.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating intuitive user interfaces that users love to interact with. Whether it's designing game mechanics, optimizing performance, or building responsive web applications, I approach each project with creativity and technical precision.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in game development and web technologies. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with teams to build something amazing.

I'm always happy to connect and discuss potential collaborations. Let's work together to create something extraordinary! ðŸš€
