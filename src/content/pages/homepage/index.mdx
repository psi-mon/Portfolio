Hi, I'm Simon Plutz, a Senior Software Engineer based in the Stuttgart Area, Germany. I'm passionate about game development, interactive systems, and creating robust backend architectures.

For over 20 years, I've been developing software solutions across multiple platforms, from Unity3D game development to web applications, mobile apps, and enterprise-grade server architectures.

My journey started with a fascination for game development and has evolved into a career building everything from educational games for children to complex business applications.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating high-performance backend systems. Whether it's designing game mechanics, optimizing performance, or building responsive web applications, I approach each project with creativity and technical precision.

I love solving complex problems, designing elegant systems, and bringing them to life through code.
